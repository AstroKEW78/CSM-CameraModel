# CSM-CameraModel

This repository stores USGS CSM compliant camera models and the associated
plugins.  These camera models are compliant with the [Community Sensor
Model](spec) and can be utilized within any application supporting the CSM.

The CSM requires associated [Image Support Data]().  This data is primarily
provided by the NASA Navigation and Ancillary Information (NAIF) SPICE system.
We provide a seperate CSM-SpiceISD library to interface with the NAIF Spice
functionality and provide a standard ISD file.
