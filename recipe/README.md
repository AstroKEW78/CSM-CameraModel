# Recipe

This is an anaconda compliant recipe for building and install the CSM-CameraModel library.  This library depends upon the Community Sensor Model (CSM) libs and the  USGS CyCSM wrappers. These are automatically installed alongside the CSM-CameraModel library.   

To install run: `conda build recipe` from the root project directory.
